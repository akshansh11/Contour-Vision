The ContourVision app is designed to provide users with a comprehensive tool for image analysis through contour detection and visualization. By using advanced image processing techniques, this app allows users to upload their own images and receive detailed contour information, including edge detection, contour area, and perimeter measurements. The app offers enhanced visualizations such as edge-detected images, grayscale histograms, and annotated contour images.
